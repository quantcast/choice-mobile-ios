# Quantcast Choice - Mobile iOS Implementation Guide (Beta)

Quantcast Choice Mobile CMP (the CMP) follows the IAB TCFv2 standard.  It requires at least iOS 10.0 and greater. The CMP UX is rendered within a view controller presented on top of the rootViewController of the application.  All consent data is stored as outlined in the IAB TCFv2 mobile specs using UserDefaults.
This product requires that you sign up for Choice and register your applicaton.  Details can be found at https://www.quantcast.com/products/choice-consent-management-platform/ 

This repo is used to host our Cocoapods integration.  While you can use the framework file found here we highly recommend you instead grab it from the Choice portal or from Cocoapods.
